    <p> The BJP unexpectedly changed its leadership in Telangana on Tuesday due to internal dissent, replacing state BJP chief Bandi Sanjay with Union Minister G Kishan Reddy. It is believed that Eatala Rajender, a recent addition to the BJP, and caste were factors in the change, and that Mr Reddy's more agreeable demeanour towards the BRS could signal a potential shift in the BJP's stance towards the ruling party in Telangana.</p>
